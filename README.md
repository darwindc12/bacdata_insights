# Bacteria Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze a dataset of 200 different bacterias species to understand their distributions, typical habitats, and their potential harmfulness to humans.

## Objectives

1. **Distribution of Bacterial Families**: Identify the distributions of various bacterial families within the dataset.
2. **Habitat Analysis**: Examine the difference habitats where these bacteria are found.
3. **Harmfulness to Humans**: Determine which bacteria are harmful to humans.
4. **Correlation Between Habitat and Harmfulness**: Analyzed the correlation between the bacteria's habitat and their harmfulness to humans.

## Data

The dataset used in this analyst is sourced from Kaggle:

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection
- Load the dataset and inspect the initial few rows.
- Display of summary statistics.

### 2. Distribution of Bacterial Families
- Count the number of bacterias in each families.
- Visualize the distributions using a pie chart.

### 3. Habitat Analysis
- Count the occurrences of each habitat.
- Plot the distribution of bacteria across different habitats.

### 4. Harmfulness to Humans
- Analyzed the proportion of harmful vs. non-harmful bacteria.
- Visualize the harmfulness distribution using bar charts.

### 5. Correlation Between Habitat and Harmfulness
- Group the data by habitat and harmfulness.
- Plot the correlation between habitat and harmfulness.

### 6. Conclusion
- Summarize key insights from the analysis regarding bacterial families, habitats, harmfulness to humans, and the correlation between habitat and harmfulness.
